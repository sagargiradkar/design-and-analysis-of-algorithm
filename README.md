# List of Laboratory Assignments

This repository contains C++ programs for various laboratory assignments focusing on algorithm implementation and analysis. Each assignment covers a different algorithm or problem-solving technique. Below, you'll find a brief description of each assignment and how to use the provided code.

## Assignment 1: Fractional and 0/1 Knapsack

**Objective**: Implement Fractional Knapsack using the Greedy algorithm and 0/1 Knapsack using dynamic programming. Compare the solutions.

- `fractional_knapsack.cpp`: Implements the Fractional Knapsack problem using a Greedy approach.
- `zero_one_knapsack.cpp`: Implements the 0/1 Knapsack problem using Dynamic Programming.
- `compare_knapsack.cpp`: Compares the solutions of Greedy and Dynamic Programming approaches to show that the Greedy strategy doesn't always yield the optimal solution.

## Assignment 2: Bellman-Ford Algorithm

**Objective**: Implement the Bellman-Ford Algorithm using Dynamic Programming and analyze its time complexity.

- `bellman_ford.cpp`: Implements the Bellman-Ford Algorithm using Dynamic Programming.
- `time_complexity.cpp`: Measures and verifies the time complexity of the Bellman-Ford Algorithm.

## Assignment 3: N-Queens Problem

**Objective**: Write a recursive program to find a solution for placing N queens on a chessboard without attacking each other using Backtracking.

- `n_queens.cpp`: Implements a recursive solution for the N-Queens problem using Backtracking.

## Assignment 4: Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)

**Objective**: Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem and print the optimal path and cost using the Lower Bound Branch and Bound approach.

- `tsp.cpp`: Solves the Traveling Salesman Problem using the Lower Bound Branch and Bound method and prints the optimal path and cost.
